# Node.js Version Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem

Vercel was using Node.js 18.x which is discontinued. The error message:

```
Error: Node.js Version "18.x" is discontinued and must be upgraded. Please set Node.js Version to 22.x in your Project Settings to use Node.js 22.
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs22.x"
    }
  },
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "nodeVersion": "22.x"
}
```

### 2. Updated `package.json`

- Added `"engines": { "node": ">=22.0.0" }` to specify Node.js version requirement
- This ensures the project requires Node.js 22.x or higher

### 3. Created `.nvmrc` File

- Contains `22` to specify Node.js version for local development
- Helps with version consistency across environments

## Manual Vercel Settings (Alternative)

If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings â†’ General**
4. **Under "Node.js Version"**
5. **Select "22.x"**
6. **Save and redeploy**

## Verification

After deployment, check:

1. **Build logs** should show Node.js 22.x
2. **No more version errors**
3. **Application works correctly**

## Files Created/Modified

- âœ… `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- âœ… `package.json` - Added engines field
- âœ… `.nvmrc` - Node version specification

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Redeploy** on Vercel
3. **Verify** the deployment works without Node.js errors

The deployment should now use Node.js 22.x and work correctly! ðŸš€
